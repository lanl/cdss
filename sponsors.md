## [Advanced Simulation & Computing (ASC) Program](http://nnsa.energy.gov/asc)

Established in 1995, the Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Program supports the U.S. Defense Programs' shift in emphasis from test-based confidence to simulation-based confidence. Under ASC, computer simulation capabilities are developed to analyze and predict the performance, safety, and reliability of nuclear weapons and to certify their functionality.

The summer school receives three quarters of its funding through the Computational Systems & Software Environment (CSSE) Program. The program is managed by Timothy Randles.

## [ExaLearn](https://github.com/exalearn)

ExaLearn is a co-design center for Exascale Machine Learning (ML) Technologies and is a collaboration initially consisting of experts from eight multipurpose DOE labs. Rapid growth in the amount of data and computational power is driving a revolution in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Beyond the highly visible successes in machine-based natural language translation, these new ML technologies have profound implications for computational and experimental science and engineering and the exascale computing systems that DOE is deploying to support those disciplines.

To address these challenges, the ExaLearn co-design center provides exascale ML software for use by ECP Applications projects, other ECP Co-Design Centers and DOE experimental facilities and leadership class computing facilities. The ExaLearn Co-Design Center will also collaborate with ECP PathForward vendors on the development of exascale ML software.
