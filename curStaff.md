HPC-ENV HPC Environments

Reid is a staff scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Prior to Los Alamos, he was a research staff member at IBM Research. He holds a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Minnesota and a B.A., also in computer science, from Macalester College.

His work focuses on large-scale data analysis from both systems and applications perspectives. Recent lines of research include using social media and web traffic to monitor and forecast the spread of disease as well as developing technology to bring data-intensive computing and user-defined software stacks to existing high-performance computing systems.

In his spare time, he enjoys reading, bicycling, hiking (especially in the mountains and deserts of the American West), tinkering with things, photography, and hanging out with his wife and sons.

CCS-7 Applied Computer Science

Julien is a Computer Scientist with a background in High Performance Computing and simulation. He has experience in hybrid architectures and accelerated systems.  His postdoctorate work focuses on FleCSPH, a tool for Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics simulations based on the FleCSI framework from LANL.  The intent is to provide an efficient and distributed tree data structure to FleCSI that allows the work to be offloaded to accelerators. The final goal of FleCSPH is to simulate large Astrophysics events. 

Julien is an alumnus of the 2016 summer school class

CCS-7 Applied Computer Science

Karen is a computational scientist who is interested in understanding, designing and developing application code with the scientists. She is also a computer scientist who is interested in learning and utilizing modern computing tools to optimize algorithms or visualize complex datasets. She got her M.S. in Computational Science, Engineering and Mathematics and B.S in Computer Science at the University of Texas – Austin.
 
While at LANL during the summer of 2016, Karen joined data scientists from the Data Science at Scale team to work with Galen Gisler of LANL’s Integrated Design & Assessment group to produce visualizations and anaylsis of threats from asteroid ocean impacts. The work is summarized in a paper and video that have been awarded the first place in the SC16 Visualization Showcase.
Returning to LANL in the following summer of 2017, she worked with the data scientist from the Data Science at Scale team to develop a pattern detection filter in VTK using Fast Fourier Transform. The serial filter is currently in VTK and the distributed filter is in the development phase.
Continuing at LANL in the fall of 2017 as a Post-Master, she has also joined the Code Design team to work on the Ristra Project specifically for FleCSI.
